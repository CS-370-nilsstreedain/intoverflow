# Integer Overflow
Please proceed to the `intoverflow` folder.

You will be exploiting the integer overflow vulnerability to get the flag.

Your job is to provide malicious input to the program `launcher`. Once you run it, the program will wait for your input. It's the same program that we talked about in the lecture. Exploit the integer overflow. If you successfully inflict the overflow, you will have the flag.

Good luck.
